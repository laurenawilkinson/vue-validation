As-you-type form validation made using Vue.js

## About
This is my first real project made using Vue, so it's pretty simple and will most certainly need to be tweaked as I learn more about it. I wanted to learn the basics, and upon remembering a Twitter poll I saw about how users prefer to see form validation in real time, I decided to implement this using Vue. Improvements I want to make on this project now are to implement the elements into the virtual DOM.
